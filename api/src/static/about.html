            <p>This project aims to reduce nicotine dependence.</p>
            <h2>‚≠ê Why this project architecture?</h2>
            <p>
                I rarely use my phone and can forget about it for 6-8 hours. However, outdoors, you can't just pull out a laptop from your pocket to use the app.
                Therefore the application needs to be available on mobile device (Android) and PC (Windows).
                For this purpose, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui">.NET MAUI</a> is employed to develop a cross-platform application for all necessary devices.
                Data is stored in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, with <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix Web</a> handling communication between the client and server
            </p>
            <h2>üí° What does the application do?</h2>
            <p>The app displays the elapsed time since the last nicotine intake.
                It also shows a recommended interval that increases over time.
                Before attempting to break this interval and smoke again, the app will provide a warning to help prevent this.
                Additionally, the app allows users to view statistics and logs</p>
